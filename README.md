## Hi, I'm Muhammed Sinan 👋

I’m a **Data Science undergraduate** who builds **end-to-end machine learning systems**, not demo notebooks that stop at training.

My focus is on **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and MLOps** — taking ideas from raw data to reproducible, deployment-ready pipelines. I care about **real-world impact, explainability, and clean system design**, not just accuracy numbers.

---

### 🔍 What I Do
- Build **real-time computer vision systems** using YOLOv5  
- Develop **explainable deep learning models** with Grad-CAM  
- Design **end-to-end MLOps workflows** for scalable ML experiments  
- Convert ML outputs into **actionable insights**, not charts for decoration

### 🧠 Tech Stack
**Languages:** Python, SQL  
**ML/DL:** Machine Learning, Deep Learning, CNNs, Transfer Learning  
**Computer Vision:** OpenCV, YOLOv5, Object Detection  
**Explainability:** Grad-CAM  
**MLOps:** ML Pipelines, Experiment Tracking, Model Versioning  
**Data & Viz:** Power BI, Tableau, Streamlit, Matplotlib  
**Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook
